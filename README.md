# Automated Image Captioner
The idea of this program is to read an image and give a textual description of it. It uses concepts of NLP, CNN and RNN to process the information. This was designed using Python3 on Jupyter Notebooks.

## Steps to follow:
- In this project we have used Flickr 8k dataset for training and testing the model. Click [this link](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_Dataset.zip) for downloading the dataset and [this link](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_text.zip) for downloading the caption folder.
- Put these two folders along with this repo's jupyter notebook on the same folder.
- Now that you are ready with the setup, go to the jupyter notebook code and edit the path directories present in second cell.
- You are ready to go, run the cells serially, and the training begins at some point. The training takes fairly long time if you are using CPU.
- After that you can test with any image input, and observe the results.
